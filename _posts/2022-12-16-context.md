Raleigh, North Carolina is in the process of building NC-540, a beltway through Raleigh's outer suburbs in Wake County. The most recent portion opened in 2012, primarily serving the towns of Apex, Cary, and Morrisville. The next portion of NC-540 is expected to open in 2023, and will primarily serve the towns of Holly Springs, Fuquay Varina and Willow Spring. My project seeks to answer: **how might the NC-540 highway impact home values in the towns where NC-540 is slated to open in 2023?**

## Data
My analysis uses the following datasets, all provided courtesy of Wake County:

* Wake County Real Estate data: Records of all real estate sales in Wake County up to November 2022.
  - I filtered down this dataset to single-family homes in our six towns of interest: those that already have access to NC-540 (Apex, Cary, and Morrisville); and those that are slated to gain access to NC-540 in 2023 (Holly Springs, Fuquay Varina, and Willow Spring).
  - I was left with 104,058 homes across our six towns.
* Wake County Real Estate georeferences addresses
  - I used this dataset to georeference the house sales dataset.
* Wake County highways
* Wake County planning jurisdictions
* Raleigh neighborhoods
* Raleigh-Durham Airport Zoning

## Methods
My process to answer my research questions was as follows:
* Use a K-means cluster analysis to identify homes with similar characteristics in highway and non-highway towns.
  - cluster similarity was based on acreage; year of sale; year built; liveable square footage; and the number of stories.
* Evaluate the mean sale price difference between houses that were in the same group, but were in different highway/non-highway towns.
  - The difference in sales price between otherwise similar homes can therefore be attributed to the presence of the highway.
* Build a regression model to predict home values for homes in towns with a highway.
* Predict my inlaws' new home value using this model, based on their distance to the incoming highway.
