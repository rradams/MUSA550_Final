Raleigh, North Carolina is in the process of building NC-540, a beltway through Raleigh's outer suburbs in Wake County. The most recent portion opened in 2012, primarily serving the towns of Apex, Cary, and Morrisville. The next portion of NC-540 is expected to open in 2023, and will primarily serve the towns of Holly Springs, Fuquay Varina and Willow Spring. 

My project seeks to answer: **how might the NC-540 highway impact home values when it opens in 2023?**

This project is also personally motivated: my partner's parents live in a Wake County and NC-540 will open in their town next year. Occassionally they wonder aloud how the new highway will affect their home's value. My analysis will try to answer that question.

## Data
My analysis uses the following datasets, all provided courtesy of Wake County:

* [Wake County Real Estate data](https://www.wakegov.com/departments-government/tax-administration/data-files-statistics-and-reports/real-estate-property-data-files): Records of all real estate sales in Wake County up to November 2022. I filtered down this dataset to 104,058 single-family homes in six towns of interest: 
  -  **Highway towns**: Towns that already have access to NC-540: Apex, Cary, and Morrisville; and
  -  **Non-highway towns**: Towns slated to gain access to NC-540 in 2023: Holly Springs, Fuquay Varina, and Willow Spring.
* [Wake County Real Estate address points](https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/Wake::address-points/explore?location=35.699997%2C-78.556707%2C2.78)
* [Wake County highways](https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/Wake::highways-in-wake-county-nc/explore?location=35.794198%2C-78.570954%2C3.54)
* [Wake County planning jurisdictions](https://data.wakegov.com/datasets/Wake::planning-jurisdictions/explore?location=35.771788%2C-78.601100%2C4.00)
* [Raleigh neighborhoods](https://data.wakegov.com/datasets/ral::raleigh-neighborhood-registry-3/explore?location=35.776186%2C-78.638248%2C9.43)
* [Raleigh-Durham Airport Zoning](https://data.wakegov.com/datasets/Wake::airport-zoning/explore?location=35.878029%2C-78.743845%2C5.61)

## Methods
My process to answer my research questions was as follows:
* Identify similar homes in both highway and non-highway towns using a K-means cluster analysis.
* Evaluate the difference in home values between otherwise similar homes in highway and non-highway towns. The difference can therefore be attributed to the presence of the highway.
* Build a regression model to predict home values based on proximity to the highway.
* Predict my in-laws' new home value using this model, based on their distance to the incoming highway.
