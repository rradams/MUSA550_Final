# Results
My model, trained and tested on more than 76,000 home sales in highway towns, predicted that my in-laws' home value will **increase by 35.1%**. Congrats, Ken and Val!

# Limitations
Ken and Val, before you get too excited - I would be remiss not to mention the caveats and limitations to this estimation. 

First, **I am not a real estate expert of any kind; this figure should not be taken as expert advice or opinion, but merely a possible estimation.**

Second, this estimation was made based on house sales in highway towns (Cary, Morrisville, and Apex). It is entirely possible that there is something going on in those towns' real estate market that is different from your town's market, that my model doesn't account for. **A better way to think of the result is, "If our house were plopped down at random in Cary, Morrisville, or Apex, it would probably be worth 35% more."**

Third, home value won't change overnight. A recent study of real estate values and highway infrastrucre in North Carolina (including NC-540) found that **it takes, on average, about 6-8 years for highway infrastrucre's effect on home prices to mature. So, the 35% gain in value is likely to mature by 2029-2031.**

Fourth, my model doesn't account for how the highway will impact your town - perhaps the town will generate further buisness and residents and become more similar to Cary, Morrisville, and Apex; or, it might change in an entirely different way and cause home values to shift in a new an unexpected way.

Finally, all of these estimates assume that your home has stayed exactly the same as its original sale conditions. Any investments (or devestments) to the property counld also impact your home's value, and my model doesn't take this into account.
