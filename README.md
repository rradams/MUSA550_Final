North Carolina is building NC-540, a beltway through Raleigh’s suburbs in Wake County. The most recent portion opened in 2012, primarily serving the towns of Apex, Cary, and Morrisville. The next portion of NC-540 is expected to open in 2023, and will primarily serve the towns of Holly Springs, Fuquay Varina, and Willow Spring.

My project seeks to answer: **how might the NC-540 highway impact home values when it opens in 2023?**

This project is also personally motivated: my partner’s parents live in Wake County and NC-540 will open in their town next year. Occassionally they wonder aloud how the new highway will affect their home’s value. My analysis will try to answer their question.
